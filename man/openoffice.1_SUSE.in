.SH DESCRIPTION
OpenOffice.org is a fully featured office suite for the daily use with all
features you would normally expect in a office suite.

This script runs OpenOffice with the arguments <args> given on the command line.

There are also some wrapper scripts in /usr/bin which run the wanted
OpenOffice.org module.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIfilename\fR...
Files to operate on. Opening them is the default behavior, which can be
influenced by command line arguments. \fB\-p\fR will print the files instead.
.TP
\fB\-accept=\fIaccept\-string\fR
Notifies the OpenOffice.org software that upon the creation of "UNO Acceptor
Threads", a "UNO Accept String" will be used.
.TP
\fB\-base\fR
Starts with the database wizard.
.TP
\fB\-calc\fR
Starts with an empty Calc document.
.TP
\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR
This option specifies the X server to contact; see \fBX\fR(7)
.TP
\fB\-draw\fR
Starts with an empty Draw document.
.TP
\fB\-global\fR
Starts with an empty Global document.
.TP
\fB\-headless\fR
Starts in "headless mode", which allows using the application without user
interface.

This special mode can be used when the application is controlled by external
clients via the API.
.TP
\fB\-help\fR|\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-?\fR
Lists the available OOo\-native command line parameters to the console.
.TP
\fB\-impress\fR
Starts with an empty Impress document.
.TP
\fB\-invisible\fR
Starts in invisible mode.

Neither the start\-up logo nor the initial program window will be visible.
However, the OpenOffice.org software can be controlled and documents and
dialogs opened via the API.

When the OpenOffice.org software has been started with this parameter, it can
only be ended using the taskmanager (Windows) or the kill command
(UNIX based systems).

It cannot be used in conjunction with \-quickstart.
.TP
\fB\-math\fR
Starts with an empty Math document.
.TP
\fB\-minimized\fR
Keep the splash screen minimized.
.TP
\fB\-n \fIfilename\fR
Creates a new document using \fIfilename\fR as a template.
.TP
\fB\-nodefault\fR
Starts the application without any window opened for the first time.
A window appears if you start the office next time.

It is used together with the option \fB\-nologo\fR by quickstarters. Note that
the option \fB\-quickstart\fR has not been longer supported since
OpenOffice.org 2.0.0.
.TP
\fB\-nolockcheck\fR
Disables the check for remote instances using the installation.
.TP
\fB\-nologo\fR
Disables the splash screen at program start.
.TP
\fB\-norestore\fR
Disables restart and file recovery after a system crash. It is possible OOo
will try to restore a file it keeps crashing on, if that happens \fB\-norestore\fR
is the only way to start OOo.
.TP
\fB\-o \fIfilename\fR
Opens \fIfilename\fR for editing, even if it is a template.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIfilename\fR...
Prints the given files to the default printer and ends. The splash screen
does not appear.

If the file name contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
.TP
\fB\-pt \fIprintername\fR \fIfilename\fR...

screen does not appear.

If the file name contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
.TP

Starts with the given Impress file and starts the presentation. Enters edit
mode after the presentation.
.TP
