to run the tests 

build
=====
    dmake

windows
=======
   a) you can download a cygwin bash shell environment and install perl ( http://cygwin.com/setup.exe ) 
      from the cmdline './runTest.pl $(OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH)' should run the testclient and compare the logs
   b) use ordinary windows perl [1], but additionally you will need the 'diff' program for window ( download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm )
     
[1] for the testclient the perl ( all inclusive ) bundle from ActivePerl is mor e than adeqate ( download from http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/Windows/5.8/ActivePerl-5.8.8.822-MSWin32-x86-280952.msi )

   to run all test cases type
   'perl ./runTest.pl $(OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH)'
   to run a test case type
   'perl ./runTest.pl $(OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH) testfilename'

unix
====

assuming perl is installed
      './runTest.pl $(OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH)'
    or './runTest.pl $(OFFICE_PROGRAM_PATH) testfilename' for one file test.


Note: For either windows or unix all of the tests should pass ( and you should get a result like )

Note also: the testclient will attempt to connect to an existing instance of open-office, when the testClient exits the soffice process may still be running, if you wish to repeat tests you may want to kill the office instance before re-running.
