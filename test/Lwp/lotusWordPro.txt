Hi,

This is Ashwanth. I am right now experimenting with the Lotus SmartSuite97. Well, our OpenOffice is any day better than this suite ;-) :-). Anyway, in order that OpenOffice is truly as great as it is supposed to be, we need to make it  compatible with the Lotus SmartSuite file formats as well. And so, here I am, ready to take off.

Thanks and regards
Ashwanth
